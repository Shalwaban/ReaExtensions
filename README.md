# ReaExtensions
Extensions for REAPER.

It can be installed via [ReaPack](https://reapack.com) -- a package manager for Reaper. If ReaTeam/Extensions is not listed among your default repositories, you can add the repository manually with this [URL](https://github.com/ReaTeam/Extensions/raw/master/index.xml), or via [direct download](https://github.com/juliansader/ReaExtensions/tree/master/js_ReaScriptAPI/) -- copy the file to REAPER's /UserPlugins directory.

The idea behind this extension is to make all the useful and powerful functions that are available to C++ extensions available to ReaScripts too. The resulting ReaScript API is therefore not the result of my own amazing programming skills, but is mostly just an interface to existing C++ functions.

The online documentation for the corresponding C++ functions is probably the best place to learn how to use these functions. For example, Window messages and Drawing with GDI.
